Use execute_code to fetch the HTML from https://www.honolulu.gov/clerk/clk-council-calendar/\n2. Inspect the HTML to find the correct selectors for:\n   - Container/item selector (what wraps each data item)\n   - undefined selector\n   - undefined selector\n   - undefined selector\n   - undefined selector\n   - undefined selector\n   - undefined selector\n3. Determine if page needs Puppeteer (dynamic JS) or Cheerio (static HTML)\n4. Build the scraper code\n5. Use execute_code to TEST the scraper\n6. Fix any errors and verify ALL fields extract data (not null)\n7. Return the final working code in a code block\n\nCRITICAL: \n- Find selectors by inspecting actual HTML, don't guess\n- Test the scraper to ensure fields are NOT null\n- If fields are null, inspect HTML again and find better selectors\n- End with the final code in a markdown code block",
