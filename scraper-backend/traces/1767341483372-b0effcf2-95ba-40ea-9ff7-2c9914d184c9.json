I can indeed execute Python code and interact with files, but I don't have direct access to your local file system or internet connectivity for downloading tools or running scripts that require external resources.\n\nHowever, I can help you write Python code that interacts with files, and we can simulate running scripts using the `execute_code` function. Here's an example of how you can write to a file in Python:\n\n```python\nwith open('example.txt', 'w') as f:\n    f.write('Hello, World!\\n')\n    f.write('This is a test.')\n```\n\nTo run this code, please provide it using the `execute_code` function. If you have any specific scripts or tools you'd like to use, please share them with me so I can help you modify and execute them accordingly.",
